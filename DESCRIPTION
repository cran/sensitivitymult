        Outcomes

Description: Sensitivity analysis for multiple outcomes in observational studies.  For instance, all linear combinations of several outcomes may be explored using Scheffe projections in the comparison() function; see Rosenbaum (2016, Annals of Applied Statistics) <doi:10.1214/16-AOAS942>.  Alternatively, attention may focus on a few principal components in the principal() function.  The package includes parallel methods for individual outcomes, including tests in the senm() function and confidence intervals in the senmCI() function.
